# openhabTouchPanel
This repository is the start of my new OpenHAB smart house touch panel. 
Technologies used so far: JavaScript, React.js and Twitter Bootstrap

## installation
- clone the repository into for example openhab/webapps/panel 
- start openhab
- go to localhost:8080/panel

## Notes
Currently the touch panel software fetches a sitemap called panel.sitemap, and shows only some of the items.

More details to come...
